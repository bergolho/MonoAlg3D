.GUIDE TO CONFIGURE THE MONOALG_3D ON A UBUNTU 18.04 LTS MACHINE

Step 1) Update your packages
	$ sudo apt-get udpate
- Reboot your system

Step 2) Install NVIDIA drivers and essential libraries for CUDA	
	- Go to the Software Ubuntu Center and open the advance settings by selecting Softwares and Updates next to Activities on the top corner
of your screen.
	- Select Additional Drivers
	- Mark the propritary NVIDIA driver that has been tested and click on Aplly Changes
	- Reboot your machine

	- Verify if the configuration was correct by going to Settings > Details. Your NVIDIA graphics card name should be on the Graphics section now.

	- Install the CUDA libraries by running:
		$ sudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-dev

	- Check if everything is working fine
		$ nvidia-smi

Step 3) Install CUDA 9.1
	- Download the runfile
		$ wget -nc https://developer.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/9.1/Prod/local_installers/cuda_9.1.85_387.26_linux 

	- Mount a temporary partition to store the instalation files
		$ sudo mount -o bind /var/tmp /tmp

	- Change the script permission
		$ chmod +x cuda_9.1.85_387.26_linux.run

	- Install the toolkit
		$ sudo ./cuda_9.1.85_387.26_linux.run --tmpdir="/tmp" --override

	! When the installer ask you about for the installation of the CUDA driver, select No, since you already installed this package.

	- Edit the "/usr/local/cuda/crt/host_config.h" file and change line 113 to:

	#if __GNUC__ > 10 

	- Edit your ".bash_profile":

	PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin:/usr/local/cuda-9.1/bin
	LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/lib
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda-9.1/lib64:$HOME/lib
	CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH:$HOME/NVIDIA_CUDA-9.1_Samples/common/inc:$HOME/include
 
	export PATH
	export LIBRARY_PATH
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH

	- Create a symbolic link

		$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gcc-5 /usr/local/cuda/bin/gcc
		$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/g++-5 /usr/local/cuda/bin/g++

Step 4) install VTK

	- Download the version 7.1.1 of VTK:
		$ wget -nc https://www.vtk.org/files/release/7.1/VTK-7.1.1.tar.gz

	- Extract the downloaded file
		$ tar -xf VTK-7.1.1.tar.gz

	- Make a new folder to store the build files:
		$ mkdir VTK-build; cd VTK-build
	
	- Build the VTK files:
		$ ccmake ../VTK-7.1.1 	

	- Press the 'c' key to configure. Next apply the configuration settings by hitting 'c' again. Generate the Makefile by pressing 'g'.
	  Finally, we can build the VTK files by running:

		$ sudo make install 

Step 5) Install GTK-3 and Vulkan libraries 

	$ sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev libvulkan-dev
