1) Merged Sachetto changes since 19/03/2019

2) Fix bugs: 
    - On the "free_grid" function there was a bug when dealing with Purkinje network, the program
    could not be finished correctly.
    - On "vtk_polydata_grid.c" file the name of the datatype to be saved was set to "realcpu_32"
    instead of "Float32".

3) Upgrades:
    - Add a description and more comments for the usage of "calc_APD.py" script.
    - Add a new script to plot several action potentials in one single axis 
        ("plot_multiple_potentials.py").
    - Add a new program in the scripts folder to calculate and dump the positions (x,y,z) of every single cell in the grid to a file.
        ("cell_positions_calculator")
    - Add a new program in the scripts folder to calculate the propagation velocity between two cells in the grid.
        ("calc_propagation_velocity")
    - Add new Purkinje networks that were build using the "Network-Generator" for testing.
