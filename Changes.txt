1) New assembly_matrix function 'ddm_assembly_matrix'. 
Mathematics can be reviewed on the paper 'Formulacao_variacional_DDM.pdf'

2) New parameter that can be configure over the assembly_matrix section called 'cell_length'

3) New macro function ALPHA_CM for simulations that use lengths in centimeters and simplifies
the 'beta' and 'cm' parameters.

4) New function 'update_monodomain_ddm'. For the new formulation of the right-hand side of the 
linear system.

5) A new parameter in the 'struct element' called 'direction'. 
Which stores the direction where the flux is going through the connection.

6) Update the 'getAps.sh' script to allow the user to pass which cell id they want to get.

7) A new python script 'plot_potential.py' for plotting an action potential from the file 
generated by the 'getAps.sh' script.
