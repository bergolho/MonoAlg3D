Sachetto
- Options to start the simulations unpaused and to not stop the simulation on closing window.
- Rewrite the flags parsing using: https://github.com/kgabis/kgflags/blob/master/examples/full_api.c
- Correct the domain version that sets the two scars and the fibrosis from file (maybe the error is on extra-data)
- Compare the mesh with the mesh from the scientific reports paper
- Use a sparse matrix format and take the matrix out of the alg mesh (http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/c_src/csparse/csparse.html)
- Rewrite some library APIs (maybe we need only the config to be passed to the library function)

Berg
- Implement 'save_vtk_polydata_grid_as_vtu_compressed' function
- Implement coupling between Purkinje and tissue
- Implement multi-celular-model solver (use the 'extra_data' data structure as Sachetto suggested)
- Try to reduce the size of the files generated by the "calc_apd_full_grid.py" script

Pedro
- Upgrade and refactor the DDM code.
- Rewrite the 'update_monodomain' function for the DDM case
- Implement the anisotropic case for the DDM. 
    The kappas can be different now along the control volumes
