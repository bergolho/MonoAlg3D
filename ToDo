- Rewrite the flags parsing using: https://github.com/kgabis/kgflags/blob/master/examples/full_api.c
- Correct the domain version that sets the two scars and the fibrosis from file (maybe the error is on extra-data)
- Compare the mesh with the mesh from the scientific reports paper
- Use a sparse matrix format and take the matrix out of the alg mesh (http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/c_src/csparse/csparse.html)
- Rewrite some library APIs (maybe we need only the config to be passed to the library function)

Berg
- Improve the write activation time map function and make it work with the other save_mesh functions
- Implement 'save_vtk_polydata_grid_as_vtu_compressed' function
- Implement coupling between Purkinje and tissue
- Try to reduce the size of the files generated by the "calc_apd_full_grid.py" script

Pedro
- Change the DDM code to the new version of the 'fill_discretization_matrix' function
- Implement the anisotropic case for the DDM. 
    The kappas can be different now along the control volumes
