- Correct the save file in the GUI
- Implement options window for GUI

- Use a sparse matrix format and take the matrix out of the alg mesh (http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/c_src/csparse/csparse.html)
- Rewrite some library APIs (maybe we need only the config to be passed to the library function)
- Implement compressed data on vtk files https://github.com/lz4/lz4/blob/dev/examples/simple_buffer.c
